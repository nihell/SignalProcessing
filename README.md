# Bearing fault detection with topological data analysis

### Author: Niklas Hellmer, github.com/nihell, nhellmer at impan dot pl

This repo accompanies our recent paper LINK.

The monte-carlo simulations with synthatic data can be reproduced using the run_simulations script. The code for generating the time series is symulacja_py.py.

The idler_data and vibstand_data notebooks provide the analysis of data from the lab and the actual mine, respectively.

The technical part of the code is contained in TDASignaltools.py.

All the resulting figures shown in the paper are stored in the results folder.

Data files are available upon request.
